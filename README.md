### CODE DETAILS

IMPLEMENTATION:
  We expect that our solution has been completely and correctly implemented.

  Our solution makes use of modularity and object oriented design to program various functions on a Roomba.

  All functions take a blackboard object complete with the
  following attributes:
    BATTERY_LEVEL
    SPOT
    GENERAL
    DUSTY_SPOT
    HOME_PATH

  Function(s) Implemented Include:
    battery_check
    go_home
    dock
    battery_charge
    cleaning_function
    spot_check
    battery_deplete
    complete
